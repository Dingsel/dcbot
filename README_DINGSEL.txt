(remove this file before merging)

the whole bot's systems have put into their own respective folders as you can see. i can confirm the commands and events are working. 
the only way to add the handlers was via node's 'require' and it's very hard to do with imports hence why i had to go through and change them.

the commands ping, manifest, and uuid have been put in embeds.
also, if you need help grasping the handlers in any way, ask me and i'll be happy to explain it all.

i also setup a very basic message command. it doesn't really do anything, but if you want to expand on it and add more commands there's an example

OH and last thing i changed the types from numbers to enums as they're generally a better system (it's more descriptive than a number).
